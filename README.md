What I Learned

This project was mainly focused on understanding how to convert plain HTML into reusable React components. I learned how to break a UI into smaller pieces, identify components that can be reused, and structure them in a way that is flexible for future changes. It helped me think more clearly about component design, reusability, and planning ahead for updates or new features.
